# Building the projects

Retrieve project sources
--------

Clone project from github.ibm.com and switch to lift_and_switch branch

    git clone git@github.ibm.com:jAWS/ToDo-app.git
    cd ToDo-app
    git switch lift_and_switch
    git status

Result:

      On branch lift_and_shift
      Your branch is up to date with 'origin/lift_and_shift'.


Building the backend app
--------

1. To build run: 

        cd spring-boot-server
        mvn package

2. Built artifact is present in: `target/*.jar` file


Building the frontend app
--------

1. Have NodeJS installed (LTS version is preffered, 18.12.1 is latest LTS). I have 16.15.0, this is version about 6 months old, should work just fine.

2. Install angular CLI globaly with npm (node package manager) -> if you have yarn, you can use that.

        npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Clone GitHub repository and navigate to angular app
application is located in angular-11-client/ folder.

4. Install applicationâ€™s dependencies
    
        npm install

5. To build application, simply run:

        ng build

    You can also run ng build --prod, which will produce optimized production bundle.
    
    Difference between them is first one also has map files to allow tracing errors and issues to specific code.

    Production bundle will just produce mostly useless stacktrace, as compiled JS code is optimized for performance.


Produced bundle can be found in dist/Angular11Crud/ folder, you can just copy-paste this bundle into AWS S3 bucket

# Running localy (optional for next steps)

Starting Localstack
--------
To be able to run the app locally, run Localstack using docker-compose (alternatively run podman-compose cmd instead of docker-compoose) first:

    cd docker-compose
    docker-compose up

Running the backend app locally
--------

1. Run (in project root folder): 

        cd spring-boot-server
        mvn spring-boot:run

2. To prove deployment suceeded, run:

        curl http://localhost:8080/api/tutorials

Running the frontend app
---------

1. Run:
    
        npm run start

    (which runs ng serve internally)
    
    OR 
        
        ng serve

Application is then started on port defined in angular.json (by default 4200).
