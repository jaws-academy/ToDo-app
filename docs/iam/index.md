# Introduction: IAM service

Root account is not recommend to perform everyday tasks. 

Root user credentials are only used to perform a few account and service management tasks.

Anyone who has root user credentials for your AWS account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account, including billing information.

AWS Identity and Access Management

- [AWS - IAM LINK ](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)


You can create IAM identities (users, groups, roles) and assign custom permissions sets (IAM policies) to those identities. 

This allows you to grant each user access to only the services, resources, and information that they need to perform tasks. 

Each user can also be assigned unique security credentials, access keys, and multi-factor authentication devices.

It's a best practice to grant the least privilege for only the permissions required to perform a task.
